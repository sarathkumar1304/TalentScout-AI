## üß∞ Technical Details
Libraries Used:

**Streamlit**: Frontend and interactive web app.
**google-generativeai**: Integration with Google PaLM API.
**PyPDF2**: For PDF parsing and data extraction.
**json**: For saving and exporting responses.
**Model Details:**

Uses Google PaLM API (Gemini-Pro) for question generation and conversational AI.
### Architectural Decisions:

Modular design with separate classes for resume parsing, manual entry, and question generation.
State management via st.session_state in Streamlit for retaining user inputs.
## üí° Prompt Design
Prompts were carefully crafted to:

Extract specific technical skills from candidate resumes.
Generate focused and relevant technical questions.
Facilitate smooth user interactions through clear instructions and feedback collection.
### Example Prompt:
"Generate 5 technical interview questions based on the skill: Python"

The model processes this prompt to create targeted and well-structured questions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions
Challenge 1: Handling Disappearing Text Areas
Issue: User responses in text areas were disappearing upon UI interactions.
Solution: Managed st.session_state effectively to persist user inputs.
Challenge 2: Resume Parsing
Issue: Difficulty in extracting structured data from varying resume formats.
Solution: Used PyPDF2 for text extraction and implemented robust parsing logic.
Challenge 3: API Response Latency
Issue: Delay in question generation using the Google PaLM API.
Solution: Implemented caching mechanisms and progress indicators to improve user experience.
## üìå Future Enhancements
Add support for additional file formats (e.g., Word documents).
Enhance question generation using fine-tuned models.
Introduce analytics dashboards for visualizing candidate responses.
